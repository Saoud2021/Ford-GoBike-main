# Why this project?
> Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

# Questions to be answered:
>-What is the best day to launch a new service ?
>-What is the best Station to launch a new service ?
>-What customer segment should be targeted ? 
>-Does age or gender affect trip duration ? 

# Summary of findings :
Despite the fact that the dataset we have is just about the month of febuary but we did manage to get to know the following : 
1.	the best day or the busiest day is 28th of FEB “Thursday ”
2.	the commonly busy station  is Market St at 10th St > 
3.	Most of our users are male customers between the age of 28 and 33 
4.	Age certainly affects trip duration but gender doesn’t as we see longer duration trips is not dominated by one gender 

# Key Insights for Presentation

Most common age is 33 with a total number of 10000 users 
relation between gender and Duration shows male users with the longest trip duration 
relation between age and Duration and gender shows male and female users at the age of 30 with the longest trip duration
